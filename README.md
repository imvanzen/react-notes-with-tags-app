# Simple React Notes App

This App allows to user create, update and delete notes and attach tags to these notes.

Based on Kyle's [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j898RGRw0b4) tutorial from [WebDevSimplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified) 

## Todo
- Add state management with React Context
- Avoid Prop drilling
- Improve displaying layout while no notes are added
